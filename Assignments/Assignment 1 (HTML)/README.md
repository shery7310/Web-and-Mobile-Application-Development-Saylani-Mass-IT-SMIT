##  Task:

Dear Students ,

Your HTML Assignment 1 has been assigned. This is your very first step into the world of web development, and I want each one of you to complete it with full dedication and focus.

Remember , every expert developer started with simple tags like `<html>` and `<body>` . This assignment will build your foundation, your confidence, and your understanding of how the web truly works. Do it with passion, do it with patience, and do not worry about mistakes. Mistakes are part of your learning, and learning is what makes you a real developer.

Submission date is 30 November 2025 till 10:00 PM.
The submission process will be explained in class next week. For now, just complete as much of the assignment as you can. The remaining tasks will be discussed next week in class.

Form related tasks will be done next week, so you do not need to attempt them right now. The rest of the tasks that you have studied so far should be completed properly.

Give your best. Your journey has just begun, and I believe in every one of you.

-  Muhammad Umair Ahmad
